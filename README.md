jsqis: Javascript Quantum Information Simulator
===============================================

jsqis, at its core, is a [quantum
computer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computer) simulator
written in Javascript.  It allows initialization of quantum registers
and their manipulation by means of [quantum
gates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gate).

Additionally, when used in the browser, jsqis provides a lucid visual
representation of a system of quantum bits.  This representation is
mathematically precise, allowing people to reason about quantum
computing without having mastered any topics in mathematics.

This package is meant for both instructional purposes and self
learning through experimentation.  It was originally implemented as a
visual aid for a [presentation about quantum
computing](http://www.meetup.com/Los-Angeles-Hacker-News/events/81455742/)
given at the LA Hacker News Meetup.
